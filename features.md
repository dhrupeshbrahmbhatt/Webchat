### 4. Innovative Features

#### Hybrid Storage Model
1. **Hot Storage (Recent Messages)**
   - Store in Aleph Aggregate Messages
   - Quick access and real-time updates
   - Automatic P2P distribution

2. **Warm Storage (Recent History)**
   - Use Aleph's IPFS integration
   - Periodic aggregation of messages
   - Efficient retrieval

3. **Cold Storage (Archive)**
   - Compress and store in Aleph permanent storage
   - Content-addressed storage
   - Optional retrieval

#### Message Synchronization

### 7. Scalability Considerations

#### Message Sharding
- Implement channel-based sharding
- Distribute load across nodes
- Optimize retrieval patterns

### 2. Storage Solution

#### Primary Storage (Aleph.im)
- Use Aleph's Aggregate Messages for real-time chat
- Store message metadata on Aleph's network
- Utilize IPFS for media content
- Implement message persistence through Aleph's permanent storage

## Priority Levels
- **High**: Essential features for basic functionality
- **Medium**: Features that enhance user experience
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features

## Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Implemented
- üöß In Progress
- üìÖ Planned
- ‚ùå Blocked

## Notes
- Features will be implemented based on priority and complexity
- Security features take precedence
- UI/UX improvements will be ongoing
- Performance optimization will be considered for each feature

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to implementing any of these features, please:
1. Check the feature's status
2. Create an issue discussing implementation
3. Submit a pull request with your implementation

## Timeline
Timeline for implementation will be determined based on:
- Development resources
- Feature complexity
- User demand
- Technical dependencies

This document will be updated as features are implemented or new features are proposed.

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **True Decentralization**
   - No central server dependency
   - Distributed message storage
   - P2P message delivery

2. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Utilize Aleph's free tier effectively
   - Optimize storage usage
   - Efficient bandwidth usage

3. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling through sharding
   - Efficient message distribution
   - Optimized storage patterns

4. **Privacy**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Decentralized key management
   - Private channels

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up Aleph.im integration
2. Implement message encryption
3. Create channel management
4. Develop storage optimization
5. Build message synchronization
6. Add security features
7. Optimize performance
8. Implement UI/UX features

Would you like me to provide more detailed implementation code for any of these components?

### 3. Message Distribution System

#### Channel-based Communication
