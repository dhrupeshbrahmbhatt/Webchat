## 30-Second Pitch
*The Elevator Pitch*

"Imagine WhatsApp, but it's actually yours. We're building a decentralized messaging platform that makes censorship impossible and privacy guaranteed. Our platform, powered by Aleph.im, is doing for communication what Bitcoin did for money.

Last year, messaging apps made $200B while selling your data. We're flipping that model: your messages, your control, completely free to use. We already have a working prototype with features that make Telegram look like it's from the Stone Age. This isn't just a product; it's a communication revolution.

Join us in making communication truly free again."
